# checkoutSystem
Simple checkout system using tkinter and python for college work

The system keeps track of stock numbers, allows restocking to be saved, and can take a mix of card and cash payments.

Mistakes can be corrected using correction mode, where the product button press takes away one of the item which would've been added.
